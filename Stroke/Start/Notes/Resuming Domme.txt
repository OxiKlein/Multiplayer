Rarely the last active domme might want the sub to not have any fun with the others before talking to them again / resuming. If this is the case then if the domme is not available when the session is started the sub will be asked to check back in an hour before ending the tease.

Sometimes the active domme may ask the sub if they want to play with them instead of waiting. This will cause a short session where instead of handing off control to another, the session will end after so many scripts with no chance to orgasm. There will be a minor chance every script for the domme (that requested you wait) to return and punish you. The active domme may also just decide to snitch tell the other domme that you broke a promise during or after your short tease with her.
